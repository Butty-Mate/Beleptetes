**Introduction**
Beleptetes (Entry) is a C# application designed to manage user login and authentication processes. This application ensures secure access control for various systems by verifying user credentials and managing sessions.

<br><br>

**Features:** 

**User Registration:** 
Users can create new accounts by providing necessary details such as username, password, and email. Passwords are securely hashed before being stored.

**User Login:** 
Registered users can log in by entering their username and password. The system verifies the credentials and grants access if they match.

**Password Recovery:** 
In case users forget their passwords, they can recover them through a secure password recovery process, which involves sending a reset link to their registered email address.

**Session Management:** 
The application manages user sessions to ensure that only authenticated users can access protected resources. Sessions are securely maintained and timed out after a period of inactivity.

**Technical Details** 

1. **User Data Storage** 
User information, including hashed passwords, is stored in a secure database. The application uses SQL Server for data storage and retrieval.

2. **Password Hashing** 
Passwords are hashed using a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) to ensure that plain-text passwords are never stored.

3. **Email Integration** 
The application integrates with an email service to send verification emails, password recovery links, and other notifications to users.

4. **Error Handling** 
Comprehensive error handling ensures that any issues during registration, login, or session management are gracefully managed and communicated to the user.

5. **Logging and Monitoring** 
The application includes logging and monitoring capabilities to track user activities, detect suspicious behavior, and ensure the overall security of the system.

**User Interface** 

The graphical user interface is built using Windows Forms Apps in C#. The design is user-friendly and intuitive, ensuring a smooth user experience for registration, login, and other interactions.
